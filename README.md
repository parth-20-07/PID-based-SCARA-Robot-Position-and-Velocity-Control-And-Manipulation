# Introduction

The aim of the assignment is meant to get a better understanding of basic concepts of Robotics using tools like [ROS2 Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html), [Gazebo Sim](https://gazebosim.org/home), [RVIZ](https://github.com/ros2/rviz) and [MathWorks&#174; MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
The final project is divided into three seperate assignments:

1. **Assignment 1:** Build Model URDF, Forward Kinematics Node and Inverse Kinematics Node.

   1. Setup the dynamically accurate model of robot in Gazebo by editing the model URDF.
   2. Calculate the DH Parameters of the Robot to build a node that:
      1. Subscribes to the joint states of the robot and calculates the Pose of the robot by using Forward Kinematics.
      2. Publishes the Pose of the Robot to a new topic using a publisher.
   3. Create an Inverse Kinematics Calculation Node that:
      1. Uses a custom service to take input of the (x,y,z) coordinates of the robot end-effector.
      2. Calculate the Joint States from the end-effector position and return it as a response to the service.

2. **Assignment 2:** Build a node to control Joint States.

   1. Create a node that takes Reference Values for Joint Position as input through a service.
   2. Build a Proportional-Derivative Controller that takes the current Joint States and Reference joint state to publish the control torque values to the **/forward_effort_controller/commands** topic.
   3. Ensure that the model reaches the reference joint states in Gazebo.

3. **Assignment 3:** Build a node to control Joint or End-Effector Velocity.
   1. Create a node with 2 services:
      1. Service 1 takes Joint Velocity as input to convert it to End-Effector Velocity as output.
      2. Service 2 takes End-Effector Velocity as input to convert it to Joint Velocity as ouput.
   2. Based on the input, build a Proportional-Derivative controller that takes the current Joint Velocity and the Reference Joint Velocity to publish the torque values to the **forward_effort_controller/commands** topic.
   3. Ensure that the model reaches the desired end-effector or joint velocity in Gazebo.

ðŸ—’ _**Note:** This project is designed on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and not tested on any other platforms_

âš  _**Warning:** Remember, If anything doesnt work as it is supposed to, just use the rules of IT. Close it and restart it again_ :smiley:

# How to setup the project

## Install ROS2 Humble Hawksbill

**Set locale**

Make sure you have a locale which supports `UTF-8`. If you are in a minimal environment (such as a docker container), the locale may be something minimal like `POSIX`. We test with the following settings. However, it should be fine if youâ€™re using a different UTF-8 supported locale.

```bash
locale  # check for UTF-8

sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale  # verify settings
```

**Setup Sources**

You will need to add the ROS 2 apt repository to your system.

First ensure that the [Ubuntu Universe repository](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu) is enabled.

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
```

Now add the ROS 2 GPG key with apt.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Then add the repository to your sources list.

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
```

**Install ROS 2 Packages**

Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories.

```bash
sudo apt update
```

ROS 2 packages are built on frequently updated Ubuntu systems. It is always recommended that you ensure your system is up to date before installing new packages.

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

Desktop Install (Recommended): ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials.

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop -y
```

## Environment Setup

**Sourcing the setup script**

Set up your environment by sourcing the following file.

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

**Extra steps just to ensure colcon is properly installed**

The [ROS project](https://www.ros.org/) hosts copies of the Debian packages in their apt repositories.

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64] http://repo.ros2.org/ubuntu/main `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2-latest.list'
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

After that you can install the Debian package which depends on `colcon-core` as well as commonly used extension packages (see [setup.cfg](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-common-extensions/blob/master/setup.cfg)).

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
```

## Gazebo Installation Tutorials

In this tutorial we will install Gazebo 11 and all its supporting files that will aid us in robot simulation.

**Gazebo**

Use the following commands to install Gazebo and its supplementry files

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
```

Once this is done, update using and make sure it runs without any errors

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Now install Gazebo using

```bash
sudo apt-get install gazebo libgazebo-dev
```

You can check your installation by running this in a new terminal

```bash
gazebo
```

**Gazebo ROS 2 packages**

To use Gazebo with ROS2, there are certain packages that need to be installed

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-gazebo-ros-pkgs
```

Now we will install simulated robot controllers

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-ros2-control ros-humble-ros2-controllers
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-gazebo-ros2-control ros-humble-xacro
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-joint-state-publisher ros-humble-joint-state-publisher-gui
```

Now your system is ready to simulate any robot.

**Spawn rrbot in Gazebo**

Before doing `colcon build` we have to install some dependencies for the package to function correctly.
Run the following commands in terminal

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install transforms3d
```

These are optional steps just to make sure everything is alright:

- Please find the zipped package that has one of many ways to spawn an URDF in Gazebo using ROS2. The unedited files can be found in the directory:

  `/Resources/Group Project 1/rrbot_simulation_files.zip`

- Extract the package to your `/src`.

Once you have successfully installed all the required packages, find the supporting zip file that contains rrbot simulation files.

**RRBOT:**

That zip file contains 2 packages:

- **rrbot_description**:
  This package contains the description files for the rrbot such as its urdf, gazebo plugins, ros2 control definitions etc.
  Xacro has been used instead of URDF to keep the description more modular, you will find that the main file _rrbot.urdf.xacro_ includes a bunch of different files, so you don't have to deal with a very large file.
  The important files for us are _rrbot.gazebo.xacro_ and _rrbot.ros2_control.xacro_, these contains the configuration for ROS2 Control.
  Visit this link for understanding how to configure ros2 control for your robot: https://github.com/ros-controls/gazebo_ros2_control
- **rrbot_gazebo:**
  This package launches the actual simulation environment.
  The _gazebo_controllers.yaml_ file in _config_ helps us define what kind of controller we want to use, here we are using a **forward_command_controller** that just takes the command and applies it as it is, we have selected position as the command interface, i.e. we will control the position of the joints, reset all will be calculated by the controller. We can also use velocity or effort (torque) as the command interface.
  The state interfaces is what kind of feedback we will receive from **JointStateBroadcastser**, here we are taking position, velocity and effort feedbacks from the robot.
  **JointStateBroadcaster** is a different type of controller, it basically reads the current joint states from simulation environment and publishes it on the topic _/joint_states_.

The launch folder contains a launch file **rrbot_world.launch.py** which will be used to launch every thing, gazebo simulation environment, controller manager for ros2 control, robot state publisher.

## Simulation

In the main folder run the following commands:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
. install/setup.bash
```

As we are using some gazebo plugins for camera, we need to source the gazebo setup bash file too

```bash
echo ". /usr/share/gazebo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Now open a new terminal to launch rrbot in gazebo and run

```bash
ros2 launch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch.py
```

This should result in a new Gazebo window popping up with rrbot spawned,
Now if you do ros2 topic list, you will be able to see a bunch of different topics
_/joint_states_ : This topic will have the robot's current state, i.e. position, velocity and efforts of each joint
_/forward_position_controller/commands_ : This is the control topic, this will be used to control the robot joints
_/camera1/image_raw_ : On this topic the robot will publish the camera feed, to visualize what the camera is seeing we can use rviz2.

ðŸ—’ _**Note:** This can also result in your system getting hanged for a few minutes, this is just a first time thing and please don't kill the node if this happens, average hang-time is around 2-3 mins, if it goes above 10 mins kill the launch file._

## [PlotJuggler](https://www.plotjuggler.io/)

Plot Juggler is a tool used for visualizing the topics with data for plotting.

Installation of Plot Juggler is pretty simple. Since we are using ROS2 Humble, we will install for the same edition of ROS.

Install the Plot Juggler using the command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-plotjuggler-ros
```

And we are all done with Plot Juggler Installation.

# How to use the project

## Assignment 1

1. Compile the project by using the command:

   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

### **Forward Kinematics Node**

2. Launch the RVIZ model in a new terminal using:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch rrbot_description view_robot.launch.py
   ```

   This will launch a Rviz windows which shows the robot model along with a a small window titled **Joint State Publisher** with three sliders to control three joints.

   1. Rviz Model Window:

![RViz Model Window](/Submissions/Group%20Project%201/RVIZ%20Window.png)

2.  Joint Publisher Model:

![Joint State Publisher Window](/Submissions/Group%20Project%201/Joint%20State%20Publisher%20Window.png)

3. In a new Terminal, Launch the Forward Kinematics node using:

   ```bash
   ros2 run rrbot_gazebo fkin_publisher
   ```

   The Node will take the Joint States from the topic `/joint_states` in the format `sensor_msgs::msg::JointState`

   The Calculated Pose is published on the topic `/forward_position_controller/commands` in format `std_msgs::msg::Float64MultiArray`

4. In a new Terminal, Echo the Forward Kinematics Topic using

   ```bash
   ros2 topic echo /forward_position_controller/commands
   ```

   The output data will be displayed as follows:

![FKIN Topic Echo](/Submissions/Group%20Project%201/FKIN%20Topic%20Echo.png)

The x coordinates is displayed at line 4.

The y coordinates is displayed at line 8.

The z coordinates is displayed at line 12.

5. Move around the sliders in the _Joint State Publisher_ Window to see the End Effector Position change.

### **Inverse Kinematics Node**

The Inverse Kinematics Node works on a server service node setup. The user can type the end-effector pose after launching the server node and request node to calculate the Joint States using a Service Call.

6. In a new terminal (_You can close all other terminals if you wish to_), Launch the Inverse Kinematics Server Node using:

   ```bash
   ros2 run rrbot_gazebo ikin_publisher
   ```

7. In a new terminal launch the service using

   ```bash
   ros2 service call /inverse_kinematics custom_interfaces/srv/FindJointStates "{x: 1, y: 0, z: 2}"
   ```

   Change the end effector position by changing the values for (x,y,z).

   The service Call will return the output in following format:

![ikin-service-call](./Submissions/Group%20Project%201/Ikin%20Service%20Call.png)

The service results two sets of possible response:

- $(q_{11}, q_{21}, q_{31})$
- $(q_{12}, q_{22}, q_{32})$

## Assignment 2

1. Compile the project by using the command:

   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

2. Launch RRBOT in Gazebo using:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch.py
   ```

   This will launch the Gazebo Window with the RRBOT spawned.

![RRBOT Gazebo Spawn](/Submissions/Group%20Project%202/Gazebo%20Model.png)

### **Joint Position Control Node**

3. Launch the Joint Control Node using:

   ```bash
   ros2 run rrbot_gazebo joint_effort_control
   ```

   The control strategy used for the Joint Control Strategy is PD Control. The system is broken down into individual joints where each joint has it's own control system. This strategy divides the whole system into 3 individual SISO System allowing us to tune Kp and Kd parameters individually.

   $$u = -K_{p}*e - K_{d}\dot{e}$$

   where:

   - $e$ is position error: $e = \theta_{r} - \theta$
   - $\dot{e}$ is rate of change of error: $\dot{e} = \frac{e_{t}-e_{t-\delta{t}}}{\delta{t}}$

4. Call the Joint Control service using:

   ```bash
   ros2 service call /joint_state_controller custom_interfaces/srv/SetJointStates '{rq1: 1, rq2: 2, rq3: 2}'
   ```

   Change the Joint States by trying different values for (rq1,rq2,rq3)

   Right Click the Video below and open in new tab to see an example

[![position-control-animation](https://img.youtube.com/vi/P_8ERXKMxVg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_8ERXKMxVg)

5. Echo the topic to see the reference Joint Position:

   ```bash
   ros2 topic echo /reference_joint_states/commands
   ```

6. We can visualize the efforts and joint states using PlotJuggler.

   Launch Plot Juggler using the following:

   ```bash
   ros2 run plotjuggler plotjuggler
   ```

   Once the plot Juggler is launched, configure the system to view the joint data as follows:

   1. Set the Streaming Tab for `ROS2 Topic Subscriber` and Buffer to `60` and press Start Button as shown:

![Plot-Juggler-Streaming-Tab](./Submissions/Group%20Project%202/PlotJuggler%20Streaming.png)

2.  After pressing the Start Button a new window will pop up with all the available topics labelled `Select ROS messages`

![Plot-Juggler-ROS-Messages-Tab](./Submissions/Group%20Project%202/PlotJuggler%20Select%20Rosmessages.png)

3.  Select the Following three topics from list:

    1. `/forward_effort_controller/commands`
    2. `/joint_states`
    3. `/reference_joint_states/commands`

4.  Right Click on the `tab1 canvas` and Select `Split Horizontally` twice so you get a layout as shown below:

![Plot-Juggler-Canvas](./Submissions/Group%20Project%202/PlotJuggler%20Canvas.png)

5.  Drag and Drop the Following Topics in each Canvas from the Publishers Tab:

    1. Canvas 1:
       1. `/forward_effort_controller/commands/data.0`
       2. `/joint_states/joint1/position`
       3. `/joint_states/joint1/velocity`
       4. `/reference_joint_states/commands/data.0`
    2. Canvas 2:
       1. `/forward_effort_controller/commands/data.1`
       2. `/joint_states/joint2/position`
       3. `/joint_states/joint2/velocity`
       4. `/reference_joint_states/commands/data.1`
    3. Canvas 3:
       1. `/forward_effort_controller/commands/data.2`
       2. `/joint_states/joint3/position`
       3. `/joint_states/joint3/velocity`
       4. `/reference_joint_states/commands/data.2`

    The complete setup for visualization should look as below:

![Plot-Juggler-Complete-Set-Canvas](./Submissions/Group%20Project%202/PlotJugger%20Set%20Canvas.png)

## Assignment 3

1. Compile the project by using the command:

   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

2. Launch RRBOT in Gazebo using:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch.py
   ```

   This will launch the Gazebo Window with the RRBOT spawned.

![RRBOT-Gazebo-Spawn](./Submissions/Group%20Project%202/Gazebo%20Model.png)

### **Velocity Control Node**

3. Launch the Velocity Control Node using:

   ```bash
   ros2 run rrbot_gazebo end_eff_vel_control
   ```

   The control strategy used for the Velocity Control Strategy is PD Control. The system is broken down into individual joints where each joint has it's own control system. This strategy divides the whole system into 3 individual SISO System allowing us to tune Kp and Kd parameters individually.

   $$u = -K_{p}*e - K_{d}\dot{e}$$

   where:

   - $e$ is velocity error: $e = \dot{\theta_{r}} - \dot{\theta}$
   - $\dot{e}$ is rate of change of error: $\dot{e} = \frac{e_{t} - e_{t-\delta{t}}}{\delta{t}}$

4. Velocity Control can be done in two way:

   1. Joint Velocity Control: Here, the velocity of joint is directly controlled and the end effector moves accordingly

   ```bash
   ros2 service call /joint_velocity_service custom_interfaces/srv/SetJointVelocity "{vq1: 1, vq2: 0, vq3: 0}"
   ```

   2. End Effector Velocity Control: Here, the velocity of End Effector is set and accordingly the Robot Joint Velocity is calculated.

   ```bash
   ros2 service call /end_effector_velocity_service custom_interfaces/srv/SetEndEffectorVelocity "{vx: 1, vy: 0, vz: 0}"
   ```

5. We can visualize the efforts and joint states using PlotJuggler.
   Launch Plot Juggler using the following:

   ```bash
   ros2 run plotjuggler plotjuggler
   ```

   Once the plot Juggler is launched, configure the system to view the joint data as follows:

   1. Set the Streaming Tab for `ROS2 Topic Subscriber` and Buffer to `60` and press Start Button as shown:

![Plot-Juggler-Streaming-Tab](./Submissions/Group%20Project%202/PlotJuggler%20Streaming.png)

2.  After pressing the Start Button a new window will pop up with all the available topics labelled `Select ROS messages`

![Plot-Juggler-ROS-Messages-Tab](./Submissions/Group%20Project%203/PlotJuggler%20Select%20Rosmessages.png)

3.  Select the Following three topics from list:

    1. `/forward_effort_controller/commands`
    2. `/joint_states`
    3. `/reference_velocities/end_effector`
    4. `/reference_velocities/joints`

4.  Right Click on the `tab1 canvas` and Select `Split Horizontally` twice so you get a layout as shown below:

![Plot-Juggler-Canvas](./Submissions/Group%20Project%202/PlotJuggler%20Canvas.png)

5.  Drag and Drop the Following Topics in each Canvas from the Publishers Tab:

    1. Canvas 1:
       1. `/forward_effort_controller/commands/data.0`
       2. `/joint_states/joint1/velocity`
       3. `/reference_velocities/end_effector/data.0`
       4. `/reference_velocities/joints/data.0`
    2. Canvas 2:
       1. `/forward_effort_controller/commands/data.1`
       2. `/joint_states/joint2/velocity`
       3. `/reference_velocities/end_effector/data.1`
       4. `/reference_velocities/joints/data.1`
    3. Canvas 3:
       1. `/forward_effort_controller/commands/data.2`
       2. `/joint_states/joint3/velocity`
       3. `/reference_velocities/end_effector/data.2`
       4. `/reference_velocities/joints/data.2`

    The complete setup for visualization should look as below:

![Plot-Juggler-Complete-Set-Canvas](./Submissions/Group%20Project%203/PlotJuggler%20Set%20Canvas.png)

6.  The setup would plot graphs as shown

![Velocity-Control-1](./Submissions/Group%20Project%203/Velocity%20Graph%201.png)

# Understanding the Assignment

## Assignment 1: Forward Kinematics Node

### position_publisher.cpp

This node is the Forward Kinematics Node. It takes **Joint Position** as input and calculates **End Effector Pose** using it.

Include Essential File Headers

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <functional>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <math.h> /* round, floor, ceil, trunc */

#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"
#include "std_msgs/msg/float64_multi_array.hpp"
#include "sensor_msgs/msg/joint_state.hpp"
```

Generating a Forward Kinematics Publisher Node

```cpp
rclcpp::spin(std::make_shared<FKin_Publisher>());
```

Define Robot Physical Parameters

```cpp
std::double_t l1 = 1, l2 = 1, ao = 0.05, lb = 1;
```

Create a subscriber that recieves **Joint States** from `/joint_states` and publishes the **Robot Pose** to `/forward_position_controller/commands`.

```cpp
rclcpp::Publisher<std_msgs::msg::Float64MultiArray>::SharedPtr fkin_publisher_;
rclcpp::Subscription<sensor_msgs::msg::JointState>::SharedPtr joint_state_subscriber_;
```

We need a publisher and subscriber for our operation.

- `fkin_publisher` : This publisher is used to publish the calculated pose from the recieved joint states.
- `joint_state_subscriber` : The subscriber subscribes to the `/joint_states` topic and the is binded to the callback function `void topic_callback(...) const` using the `std::bind(&FKin_Publisher::topic_callback, this, _1)` command.

```cpp
FKin_Publisher() : Node("minimal_publisher"), count_(0)
{
   fkin_publisher_ = this->create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::Float64MultiArray>("/forward_position_controller/commands", 10);
   joint_state_subscriber_ = this->create_subscription<sensor_msgs::msg::JointState>("/joint_states", 10, std::bind(&FKin_Publisher::topic_callback, this, _1));
}
```

The callback function is called everytime the **Joint State** subscriber recieves new Joint Values.

```cpp
void topic_callback(const sensor_msgs::msg::JointState::SharedPtr msg) const
```

The Joint Position is stored in a Vector array

```cpp
std::vector<std::double_t> joint_states = {msg->position[0],msg->position[1],msg->position[2]};
std::cout << joint_states[0] << "," << joint_states[1] << "," << joint_states[2] << std::endl;
```

Pose $(T)$ is calculated using the `joint states` using the formula

```math
T=
\begin{bmatrix}
cos(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})&-sin(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})&0&cos(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})+0.9cos(\theta_{1})\\
sin(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})&cos(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})&0&sin(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})+0.9sin(\theta_{1})\\
0&0&1&d_{3}+2.1\\
0&0&0&1
\end{bmatrix}
```

```cpp
std::double_t pose[4][4] =
   {
      {{cos(joint_states[1] + joint_states[0])},{-sin(joint_states[1] + joint_states[0])},{(0)},{cos(joint_states[1] + joint_states[0]) + (9 * cos(joint_states[0])) / 10},},
      {{sin(joint_states[1] + joint_states[0])},{cos(joint_states[1] + joint_states[0])},{(0)},{sin(joint_states[1] + joint_states[0]) + (9 * sin(joint_states[0])) / 10},},
      {{(0)},{(0)},{(1)},{2.1 - joint_states[2]},},
      {{(0)},{(0)},{(0)},{(1)},}
   };
```

A variable is created in `Float64MultiArray` format which is a 1D-vector with the information of how it should be structured to act as a multidimensional array. It is done by defining the `width` and `height` of the array as shown

```cpp
std_msgs::msg::Float64MultiArray message;
message.layout.dim.push_back(std_msgs::msg::MultiArrayDimension());
message.layout.dim[0].label = "width";
message.layout.dim[0].size = 4;
message.layout.dim[0].stride = 4 * 4;
message.layout.dim[1].label = "height";
message.layout.dim[1].size = 4;
message.layout.dim[1].stride = 4;
message.layout.data_offset = 0;
```

In order to remove any garbage data, we first fill the message variable with null value.

```cpp
message.data.clear();
```

We flatten the pose variable to be copied into the publishing variable and copy the data

```cpp
std::vector<double_t> vec(16, 0);
for (size_t i = 0; i < 4; i++)
   for (size_t j = 0; j < 4; j++)
      vec[(i * 4) + j] = pose[i][j];
message.data = vec;
```

The data is published on the topic as set before.

```cpp
RCLCPP_INFO(this->get_logger(), "Publishing...");
fkin_publisher_->publish(message);
```

## Assignment 1: Inverse Kinematics Node

### FindJointStates.srv

The task of the service file is to define the input and output data type of the service.

Here we take $x,y,z$ as input and return $q_{11},q_{12},q_{13},q_{21},q_{22},q_{23}$ as output. Both are of type `float64`. The input and output is seperated by `---` between them.

```python
float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
---
float64 q11
float64 q21
float64 q31
float64 q12
float64 q22
float64 q32
```

### joint_state_publisher.cpp

Including with essential headers.

```cpp
#include "custom_interfaces/srv/find_joint_states.hpp"
#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <memory>
```

The node with name `inverse_kinematics_server` is generated and the service with name `inverse_kinematics` is attached to it.

The service calls the `void add(...)` function when it is initiated.

```cpp
std::shared_ptr<rclcpp::Node> node = rclcpp::Node::make_shared("inverse_kinematics_server");
rclcpp::Service<custom_interfaces::srv::FindJointStates>::SharedPtr service = node->create_service<custom_interfaces::srv::FindJointStates>("inverse_kinematics", &add);
```

We round the input $x,y,z$ coordinates to 2 decimal places first and store it in variables.

```cpp
std::double_t x = round(request->x * 100) / 100; // x component of the end effector pose
std::double_t y = round(request->y * 100) / 100; // y component of the end effector pose
std::double_t z = round(request->z * 100) / 100; // z component of the end effector pose
```

We check for the values of $x,y,z$ where robot cannot reach or will face singularity. We quit the node if it is not possible to calculate the solution.

```cpp
if (std::sqrt((x * x) + (y * y)) > 2)
{
   RCLCPP_ERROR(rclcpp::get_logger("rclcpp"), "XY Values out of Bound");
   solution_possible = false;
}
if (x == 0 && y == 0)
{
   RCLCPP_ERROR(rclcpp::get_logger("rclcpp"), "XY Values not reachable. Detected Singularity");
   solution_possible = false;
}
if (z > 2.1 || z < 0)
{
   RCLCPP_ERROR(rclcpp::get_logger("rclcpp"), "Z Value out of Bound");
   solution_possible = false;
}
if (!solution_possible)
   return;
```

We define the Robot Parameters

```cpp
std::double_t lb = 2;   // length of the base of the robot
std::double_t l1 = 0.9; // length of first link
std::double_t l2 = 1;   // length of second link
std::double_t l3 = 2.2; // length of third link
```

We calculate the Joint Position using Geometrical Approach. This is done using the lambda function in cpp

```cpp
std::double_t q1_1, q1_2, q2_1, q2_2;
std::double_t q3 = lb + 0.1 - z; // prismatic joint displacement

double cos_of_q2 = (pow(x, 2) + pow(y, 2) - pow(l1, 2) - pow(l2, 2)) / (2 * l1 * l2);
auto get_q2 = [=](bool is_positive, double cos_of_q2)
{ return atan2((is_positive ? 1 : -1) * sqrt(1 - pow(cos_of_q2, 2)), cos_of_q2); };
q2_1 = get_q2(true, cos_of_q2);
q2_2 = get_q2(false, cos_of_q2);
auto get_q1 = [=](double q2)
{ return atan2(y, x) - atan2(l2 * sin(q2), l1 + (l2 * cos(q2))); };
q1_1 = get_q1(q2_1);
q1_2 = get_q1(q2_2);
```

The calculated Joint Position is rounded to 2 decimal places before submitting the response

```cpp
// allocating the joint values to the server response
response->q11 = round(q1_1 * 100) / 100;
response->q21 = round(q2_1 * 100) / 100;
response->q31 = round(q3 * 100) / 100;

response->q12 = round(q1_2 * 100) / 100;
response->q22 = round(q2_2 * 100) / 100;
response->q32 = round(q3 * 100) / 100;
```

## Assignment 2: Joint Position Control

### SetJointStates.srv

The task of the service file is to define the input and output data type of the service.

Here we take $q_{1},q_{2},q_{3}$ as input of type `float64`. The input and output is seperated by `---` between them. Since we don't have any return for this service file, the output end is kept empty. The output is displayed directly in the terminal live as the position is being achieved.

```python
float64 rq1
float64 rq2
float64 rq3
---
```

### joint_effort_controller.cpp

Include the required header files.

```cpp
#include <chrono>
#include <functional>
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <math.h> /* round, floor, ceil, trunc */

#include "rclcpp/rclcpp.hpp"
#include "std_msgs/msg/float64_multi_array.hpp"
#include "sensor_msgs/msg/joint_state.hpp"
#include "custom_interfaces/srv/set_joint_states.hpp"
```

Initialize the **joint_state_controller** node first.

```cpp
rclcpp::init(argc, argv);
auto node = std::make_shared<joint_state_controller>();
RCLCPP_INFO(rclcpp::get_logger("rclcpp"), "Starting Joint Effort Control.");
```

Switch the Gazebo Robot from **Position Controller** to **Effort Controller**.

**Position Controller:** Takes joint positions as input and calculate the efforts on its own to reach the desired position.

**Effort Controller:** Takes efforts as input and directly applies it to the Robot Joints.

```cpp
system("ros2 run rrbot_gazebo switch_eff");
system("ros2 topic pub --once /forward_effort_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray 'data: [0,0,0]'");
rclcpp::spin(node);
```

The following components are created for our usage.

- `service_` : Generate a service with name `joint_state_controller` to recieve Target Joint Position from User. The service calls the `recieve_reference_joint_position_from_service(...)` function everytime user sends the value via service call.
- `joint_state_subscriber` : Subscriber to read the joint states (position and velocity) published by the gazebo robot on `/joint_states` topic. The subscriber is binded to `void calculate_joint_efforts(...)` function which is called everytime the subscriber recieves joint states.
- `efforts_publisher` : Publishes the calculated joint efforts to the topic `/forward_effort_controller/commands` so the gazebo robot can implement it.
- `reference_value_publisher` : Takes the reference joint values from `service_` and publishes it on topic `/reference_joint_states/commands` so that it can be used to plot on graph.

```cpp
service_ = this->create_service<custom_interfaces::srv::SetJointStates>("joint_state_controller", std::bind(&joint_state_controller::recieve_reference_joint_position_from_service, this, _1));
joint_state_subscriber_ = create_subscription<sensor_msgs::msg::JointState>("/joint_states", 10, std::bind(&joint_state_controller::calculate_joint_efforts, this, _1));
efforts_publisher_ = create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::Float64MultiArray>("/forward_effort_controller/commands", 10);
reference_value_publisher_ = create_publisher<std_msgs::msg::Float64MultiArray>("/reference_joint_states/commands", 10);
```

This function is called when the user initiates a service call for a robot to reach a certain position. We have a constraint on Joint 3 because it is a prismatic joint. The prismatic joint cannot be extended more than $2.1m$ and be less than $0m$. Joint 1 and Joint 2 being revolute, have no such constraints and can rotate infintely.

If the recieved positions are within constraints, they are stored in `reference_position` variable.

The `command_received` variable is switched to `true` when service call is made.

```cpp
void recieve_reference_joint_position_from_service(const std::shared_ptr<custom_interfaces::srv::SetJointStates::Request> request)
{
   command_received_ = true;
   if (request->rq3 > 2.1 || request->rq3 < 0)
   {
      RCLCPP_ERROR(rclcpp::get_logger("rclcpp"), "Joint State 3 not reachable");
      return;
   }
   reference_position = {request->rq1,request->rq2,request->rq3};
   RCLCPP_INFO(rclcpp::get_logger("rclcpp"), "Request (q1,q2,q3): ('%f','%f','%f')", reference_position[0], reference_position[1], reference_position[2]);
}
```

`calculate_joint_efforts` function though called everytime `joint_state_subscriber` recieves the joint states, yet it is only effective once the `command_received` variable changes to `true`.

ðŸ¤” _I Know! There are much better solution that the one we have implemented. But yeah!! **It is what it is!** We couldn't think of a smarter solution at **3 AM in the morning!!**_

We store the current joint position, velocity and calculate error in position.

$$
e = \theta_{r} - \theta
$$

Our joint motion direction are switched so we are using the inverted directions.

```cpp
std::vector<std::double_t> joint_position = {msg->position[0],msg->position[1],msg->position[2]};
std::vector<std::double_t> joint_velocity = {msg->velocity[0],msg->velocity[1],msg->velocity[2]};
std::vector<std::double_t> error = {joint_position[0] - reference_position[0],joint_position[1] - reference_position[1],joint_position[2] - reference_position[2]};
```

Initial efforts are:

$$\tau_{1} = 0 N$$

$$\tau_{2} = 0 N$$

$$\tau_{3} = 9.8 N$$

$\tau_{3}$ is kept at 9.8N so that the prismatic joint can hold its position when the desired position is achieved. This is due to the fact that the object has mass of 1kg.

```cpp
apply_joint_efforts = {0, 0, 9.8};
```

The values of applied torque is changed only if the current error is greater than the acceptable error.

```cpp
if (abs(error[0]) > acceptable_error) // Joint 1
   apply_joint_efforts[0] = -(proportional_gain[0] * error[0]) - (derivative_gain[0] * joint_velocity[0]);
if (abs(error[1]) > acceptable_error) // Joint 2
   apply_joint_efforts[1] = -(proportional_gain[1] * error[1]) - (derivative_gain[1] * joint_velocity[1]);
if (abs(error[2]) > acceptable_error) // Joint 3
   apply_joint_efforts[2] = -(proportional_gain[2] * error[2]) - (derivative_gain[2] * joint_velocity[2]);
```

A `Float64MultiArray` type variable is created to store the applied torque values for publishing it.

```cpp
std_msgs::msg::Float64MultiArray message;
message.data.clear();
message.data = apply_joint_efforts;
```

The recieved joint states from the service is copied in a variable to publish it via the reference states publisher.

```cpp
std_msgs::msg::Float64MultiArray reference_joint_states;
reference_joint_states.data = reference_position;
```

The Control efforts and reference joint states are finally published to their respective topics.

```cpp
reference_value_publisher_->publish(reference_joint_states);
efforts_publisher_->publish(message);
```

Design Assumptions:

- Acceptable Error = $0.0001 m$
- Proportional Derivative (PD) Gains:
  - Joint 1 $(K_{p1},K_{d1}) = (15,17)$
  - Joint 2 $(K_{p2},K_{d2}) = (9.5,9.5)$
  - Joint 3 $(K_{p3},K_{d3}) = (491,60)$

The tuning gains are high for Joint 3 primarily due to the fact that the Joint 3 is prismatic and along the direction of gravitational force causing it to need additional force to counteract the gravity. Opposite to it, Joint 1 and Joint 2 are revolute and working in direction perpendicular to gravity, thus, being able to operate with lowered applied torque.

```cpp
std::double_t acceptable_error = 0.0001f;
std::vector<std::double_t> proportional_gain = {15, 9.5, 491};
std::vector<std::double_t> derivative_gain = {17, 9.5, 60};
```

When user presses `Ctrl+C` to close the node, a final command is sent so that the applied torques for all controllers can be set to zeros. This allows for any other node to be capable of controlling the robot along with clearing the topic of `/forward_effort_controller/commands` which won't spam the topic unnecessarily.

```cpp
rclcpp::shutdown();
system("ros2 topic pub --once /forward_effort_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray 'data: [0,0,0]'");
```
